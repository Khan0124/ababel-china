**Recommended Improvements:**
```sql
-- Add missing indexes for better performance
CREATE INDEX idx_transactions_client_date ON transactions(client_id, transaction_date);
CREATE INDEX idx_clients_status_balance ON clients(status, balance_rmb);
CREATE INDEX idx_loadings_container_status ON loadings(container_no, status);

-- Add full-text search capability
ALTER TABLE clients ADD FULLTEXT(name, name_ar, address);
ALTER TABLE loadings ADD FULLTEXT(notes, description);
```

### **2. Application Architecture Analysis**

**Current Pattern:** MVC with separation of concerns
- **Models:** Clean database abstraction with prepared statements
- **Views:** Template-based rendering with internationalization
- **Controllers:** Logical business flow management
